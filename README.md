### Leaflet Earthquake Viaualization 

#Project Structure 
This project leverages the Leaflet.js library to create an interactive map displaying real-time earthquake data. The data is sourced from the USGS GeoJSON feed, and features such as popups, color-coded markers, and a legend have been incorporated to enhance user experience and data interpretation.
